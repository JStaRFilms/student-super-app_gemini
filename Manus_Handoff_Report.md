# Manus Handoff Report: Student Super-App MUS Implementation

This report details the implementation of the Minimum Usable State (MUS) features for the Student Super-App, as per the `Project_Requirements.md` and `Coding_Guidelines.md` documents.

## Implemented MUS Requirements:

- [x] **FR-001: User Authentication:** Secure sign-up and login with matriculation number and password implemented using Next-Auth with CredentialsProvider. Password hashing with `bcrypt` is included.
- [x] **FR-002: Basic User Profile:** A basic profile page (`/profile`) displays user's name, matriculation number, and role. (Dark mode toggle is a placeholder for now).
- [x] **FR-003: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Foundation:** The `role` field has been added to the `User` model in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
- [x] **FR-004: Home Dashboard:** The main dashboard (`/`) displays the 3 latest announcements and includes a placeholder for a resource spotlight.
- [x] **FR-005: Announcements Hub:** A dedicated page (`/announcements`) lists all announcements, fetched via a tRPC procedure.
- [x] **FR-006: Academic Resource Library (View/Download):** A resource library page (`/resources`) displays resources, fetched via a tRPC procedure, with basic details and a download link.
- [x] **FR-007: Academic Resource Library (Upload):** A protected form (`/resources/upload`) allows authenticated users to upload resource information (title, file URL, type, course code, level, semester) which is saved to the database via a tRPC procedure.
- [x] **FR-008: Anonymous Feedback System:** A simple form (`/feedback`) allows anonymous feedback submission via a tRPC procedure.
